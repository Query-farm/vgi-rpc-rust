r"""Regenerate every brand asset in this repo from one master logo.

The master is committed as ``assets/logo-master.png``: the shield mark on
transparency, at the highest resolution we have.  Everything else is derived,
so a new master is a one-command reroll rather than a hand edit in two places
that drift apart:

    uv run --with pillow python scripts/regenerate_logo_assets.py

Pass ``--master PATH`` to cut the assets from a different source, which also
replaces the committed master.

There are two consumers, and only one of them is a file.  ``assets/vgi-logo.png``
is what the READMEs point at through raw.githubusercontent.com.  The other is
the landing page served by the library itself, which has no filesystem to read
from at runtime — the mark is inlined there as a ``data:`` URI, and hand-editing
a base64 blob is not something anyone should do twice.
